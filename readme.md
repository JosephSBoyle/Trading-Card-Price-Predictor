### TCPP is a project aiming to generate buy/sell suggestions based on a machine learning model.

This model is trained on data accumulated from the webscraper included in the project.

The project is based off of a 2014 Stanford University paper [1] which demonstrated strong results predicting the price of Magic: The Gathering cards.
